    "In this assignment, we will work with some common probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we have to identify what distribution we should use to model a real-life\n",
    "situation. This exercise well get you some practice doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name the most appropriate distribution and the associated parameter(s)\n",
    "- Set up equation for the distribution, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Let X be the number of heads in 30 coin flips:\n",
    "  X ~ Binomial(n=30, p=0.5)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the pdf/pmf of the distribution to calculate the desired probability, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  P(X = 15) = 0.144\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  You may calculate these probabilities either by hand (with an assist from wikipedia to look up the PMF or CDF), or use python:\n",

    "\n",
    "5. You need to find a tall person, at least 6 feet tall, to help you reach a cookie jar. 8% of the population is 6 feet or taller, and people pass by on average twice per minute.  If you wait on the sidewalk, what is the probability that you will have to wait longer than ten minutes to get some cookies?\n",

    "6. A harried passenger will be several minutes late for a scheduled 10 A.M. flight to NYC. Nevertheless, he might still make the flight, since boarding is always allowed until 10:10 A.M., and boarding is sometimes permitted up to 10:30 AM.\n",

    "7. Your cat starts to beg for dinner at 3:30 every day, and you suspect that it meows at a fixed rate. You've observed that about one fifth of the time your cat will not meow until 3:40, giving you 10 unexpected minutes of quiet. What is the probability your cat leaves you alone for 30 minutes?\n",

    "8. Somehow you ended up with two types of forks.  There are the good forks, which are big and fit a healthy bite, but there are also these small, thin ones that you don't really understand what they are for, you should probably just get rid of them.  You need two forks for you and your partner, and grab a fistful of 5.  If there are 14 forks in the drawer, of which half are the good kind, what is the probability you have at least your two required good forks?"

    "- `Number of views` is a uniform distribution over the range of 5000 and 6000.\n",
    "- `Conversion` is binomially distributed where the probability of success is `0.12` for each view.\n",
    "- Profit per sale can take on two values: 50 for wholesale and 60 for non-wholesale. There is a 0.2 probability of a sale being wholesale and 0.8 probability of being non-wholesale.
